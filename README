SpringMVC (with JSON and JSP support)
-------------------------------------

This is the basic structure of SpringMVC project with JSON and JSP support.

It implements a simple 'hello world' set of endpoints.

/hello/{name}
/json/hello/{name}

The {name} provided in both endpoints above are rendered during execution, so the JSP endpoint /hello/world will output
Hello World
